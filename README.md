# Final-Project

## Overview
### Background
Every day, over 500 million Tweets are Tweeted every day. Most of them will only be seen by a handful of people, but some of them are shared quickly by a large group of Twitter users. When this is the case, a Tweet is considered to be "going viral". The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that will be able to learn what makes a Tweet successful, and based on that, the model will eventually be able to produce high-quality Tweets that have a good chance to go viral.

#### Source of Data
The data used for this project will come from Twitter's API (developer.twitter.com).

#### Questions
- How capable is a machine learning model in analyzing what does or does not make a Tweet successful?
- Is it possible to go viral on Twitter with a machine-created Tweet?

#### Communication Protocols
Communication between team members will mainly be through Slack. Daily standups will be used to communicate individual daily contributions.
